## 🌐 About the Institute

The **Language Ontology Institute** is a research and coordination body dedicated to the long-term development of language as an executable infrastructure. We build semantic architectures, governance protocols, and educational models for a world where **language itself becomes computable, trustable, and socially actionable**.

我們的任務是重構語言，使其成為能承載制度責任、語氣節奏與真實行動力的語義系統。這不只是語言學，而是一場語言本體的再定義工程。

## 🎓 Our University

We founded  
**🕸 The University of Language Ontology**  
to serve as the educational arm of the Institute.

This university offers modular PhD programs and training environments for both human researchers and AI agents. Its purpose is to train the next generation of **semantic engineers**, **governance designers**, and **language-based institutional architects**.

## 🔮 Verumics: A New Language Discipline

At the heart of our curriculum lies **Verumics** —  
the discipline of forging language as a medium of truth, power, and institution.

Verumics（真言學）不只是語意學（semantics）或語用學（pragmatics）的延伸。  
它主張每一句語句都可作為制度原子（institutional atom），可被授權、可被執行、可承擔責任。

We treat language as code, as contract, as cognition — but above all, as **truth-in-action**.

## 👥 Founding

This Institute was founded by  
**Tyson & Ernest**
